1. CPU Utilization Insight

CPU usage increased immediately when artificial load was generated using the stress tool.

Real-time visualization confirmed that Prometheus captures metrics at configured scrape intervals.

Sudden CPU spikes help identify high-resource applications or abnormal workloads.

2. Memory Utilization Insight

Memory consumption gradually increased when applications were started and decreased after processes stopped.

Continuous monitoring allows early detection of memory leaks or abnormal memory growth trends.

3. Disk Usage Insight

Disk usage metrics showed stable consumption during idle periods.

Tracking long-term disk trends is useful for storage capacity planning and preventing disk-full incidents.

4. Time-Series Monitoring Insight

Prometheus stores metrics as time-series data, enabling historical comparisons (hourly, daily, monthly).

Historical visualization helps in trend analysis and forecasting infrastructure requirements.

5. Overall Monitoring Value

Combining Node Exporter + Prometheus + Grafana provides centralized observability of system performance.

Dashboards provide real-time visibility, while stored metrics support long-term analysis and troubleshooting.
